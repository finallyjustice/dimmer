This folder contains two benckmarks.

stream_benchmark was developed by other people with openmp and I modified it to make it support multiple threads.
lmem-benchmark was developed by me(Dongli Zhang) with pthreads. It can generate large (L) memory throughput.
smem-benchmark was developed by me(Dongli Zhang) with pthreads. It can generate small (S) memory throughput.
